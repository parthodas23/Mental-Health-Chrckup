# Mental Health Checkup System

## Overview

Our project, **Mental Health Checkup System**, is an AI-powered web application designed to help users assess their mental health by analyzing their emotions, concerns, and medication usage. The system provides personalized feedback based on user inputs, offering insights, recommendations, and potential risk levels.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Input Form:** Users can enter their age, category of concern (e.g., loneliness, anxiety, stress), and describe their mental health problems.
- **Medication Effect Analysis:** If a user is taking medication, the system evaluates whether the medication is relevant to their mental health concerns.
- **AI-Powered Assessment:** The system generates personalized descriptions and recommendations based on user inputs, providing helpful advice for mental well-being.
- **Risk Level Indication:** Based on confidence levels, the system classifies the severity of the mental health issue (e.g., low, medium, high risk).
- **Encouraging Mental Health Support:** The platform emphasizes the importance of seeking support from friends, family, and professional counselors for better well-being.

## Technology Stack

Built with **React** and powered by **OpenAI's 4o-mini**.
## Impact and Future Enhancements

This project aims to promote mental health awareness and provide a supportive space for users to reflect on their well-being. In future iterations, we plan to integrate:

- Chatbot assistance
- Real-time counseling recommendations
- Multilingual support to reach a wider audience
